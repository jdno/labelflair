_Generate a colorful palette of labels for your GitHub Issues._

Labelflair is a simple tool to generate colorful labels for GitHub Issues from a
[configuration] file. It makes it easy to define groups of related labels,
assign similar colors to them, and then synchronize them with GitHub using a
[GitHub Action].

## Usage

Labelflair can be installed as a command-line application and used locally to
generate labels, or it can be used as a [GitHub Action] to automatically create
and update labels in your GitHub repository.

### Command-line Application

The `labelflair` command-line application reads a [configuration] file and uses
that to generate a set of labels for GitHub Issues. It can be installed using
`cargo`:

```bash
cargo install labelflair-cli
```

Once installed, you can run `labelflair` in the directory where your
[configuration] file is located. It will generate a `labels.yml` file that can
be used with GitHub Actions such as [EndBug/label-sync] to create the labels
on GitHub.

### GitHub Action

The easiest way to use Labelflair is as a GitHub Action. Simply create a
[configuration] file in your repository and then add the following step to your
GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: "Sync GitHub Issues labels"
  uses: "jdno/labelflair@v0.1.0"
  with:
    config-file: ".github/labelflair.toml"
    # Only run this step on the main branch to avoid creating labels in pull requests
    dry-run: ${{ github.ref != 'refs/heads/main' }}
```

This will generate the labels from your `labelflair.toml` configuration file,
and run another GitHub Action to synchronize them with your repository.

## Configuration

The configuration file is a TOML file that defines the labels to be generated.
Labels are grouped, and each group can have a prefix, a color generator, and a
list of labels.

```toml
# .github/labelflair.toml
version = "1"

# Create a group of labels that is named "categories"
[[group]]
prefix = "C-"
colors = { tailwind = "red" }
labels = ["bug", "feature"]
```

At a minimum, each group must choose a color generator and define a set of
labels.

```toml
[[group]]
colors = { tailwind = "blue" }
labels = ["bug", "feature", "enhancement"]
```

### `colors`

The `colors` property defines how the colors for the labels in this group are
generated. Currently, only the [Tailwind CSS color palette][tailwind] is
supported. You can choose any of the available colors from Tailwind CSS, which
you can find in the [Tailwind CSS documentation][tailwind].

```toml
colors = { tailwind = "slate" }
```

### `labels`

Labels can either be defined as a simple string or as an object with a `name`
and `description`.

This is a list of simple labels:

```toml
labels = ["bug", "feature", "enhancement"]
```

But you can also provide a description for each label:

```toml
labels = [
    { name = "major", description = "Major changes" },
    { name = "minor", description = "Minor changes" },
    { name = "patch", description = "Patch changes" },
]
```

The two forms can be mixed in the same list:

```toml
labels = [
    "good first issue",
    { name = "help wanted", description = "We need your help!" },
]
```

## How-to

This section provides a few examples of common tasks you might want to perform
with Labelflair.

### Rename a Label

Labels can be renamed by changing their name in the configuration file and
adding the old name as an alias. For example, if you want to rename the label
`bug` to `defect`, you can change the configuration from this:

```toml
[[group]]
prefix = "C-"
colors = { tailwind = "red" }
labels = ["bug"]
```

to this:

```toml
[[group]]
prefix = "C-"
colors = { tailwind = "red" }
labels = [{ name = "defect", aliases = ["bug"] }]
```

This allows Labelflair's [GitHub Action] to detect that the label has been
renamed and update it accordingly on GitHub.

## Development

Contributing to Labelflair is easy! We use [Flox] to make it easy to set up a
development environment with all the required tools, so head over to its website
to learn how to install it on your machine. Once you're done, clone this
repository and run the following command to set up the development environment:

```bash
flox activate
```

This will install all the dependencies and activate them in a new shell for you.
When you're done working on Labelflair, simple exit out of the shell with `exit`
or `Ctrl+D` to deactivate the environment.
